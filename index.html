              <p>Hi there! I'm Karachi, a passionate Computer Science student at Boston University. I'm busy coding up a storm and learning everything I can about building awesome tech that makes a difference in the world. You'll also find me whipping up cozy crocheted creations, catching the latest movies/tv shows, or hitting the shops for some retail therapy. Ô∏è</p>

              <p>I'm always on the lookout for new ways to challenge myself and grow, which is why I'm super excited about finding an internship for Spring/Summer 2024! I'm a team player at heart and love collaborating with others in the tech industry. So, if you're looking for someone who's eager to learn, code like a boss, and maybe even bring a bit of homemade scarf magic to the office, let's chat!</p>

              <p>Feel free to reach out here (karachilauren05@gmail.com), and let's make something amazing together!</p>
